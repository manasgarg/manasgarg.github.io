<h3>The Many <em>Me</em>s</h3>
<p>
Inside me, there are many <i>me</i>s. One <i>me</i> works at Adobe as an Director of Machine Learning, solves technical problems and manages projects. Another <i>me</i> is curious about the physical, social and psychological environments, tries to understand them and asks the eternal question "What's the meaning of life, universe and everything?". Yet another <i>me</i> loves to travel with camera in hand, spends time in jungles and mountains and hugs very old trees. And a significant part of <i>me</i> is a son, a husband and a father.
</p>

<p>
I am the sum total of these <i>me</i>s; and a few more. I go by the name of Manas.
