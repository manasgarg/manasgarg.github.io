I was talking to Nilesh bhaiyya two days back. The topic was corruption among politicians. He made a wonderful remark:

"We all are corrupt. The corruption is in the very life of this country. You expect that someone who passes through all this corruption for 40 years and becomes a minister (paying bribes on his way up), will suddenly become all clean? Politicians come from among ourselves. If the system is clean, the politicians will naturally be clean."

Very simply put, a remarkable thought.
