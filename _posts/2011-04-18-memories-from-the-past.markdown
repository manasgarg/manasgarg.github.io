It seems to me that when you are unwell, the memories from yesteryears tend to fill your mind more than usual. I am just recovering from an episode of Malaria. During last 2 days, everything that I've looked at has reminded me of some incident from the past.

Is it because illness pulls you out of the world of future plans and your mind suddenly gets more space?
