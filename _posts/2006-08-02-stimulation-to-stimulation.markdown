The people who take dope follow a very simple cycle: stimulate yourself with dope; remain high till the effect lasts; when the effect is over, again stimulate yourself with dope.

I know almost all of us don't accept it as a valid lifestyle. But do we ever question our own lifestyle? What cycle does our lifestyle follow?

Let me substitute the word dope in the aforementioned cycle with another word. Let's say by "dash". Now it would sound like: stimulate yourself with "dash"; remain high till the effect lasts; when the effect is over, again stimulate yourself with "dash".

Now, try substituting this "dash" with words like shopping, party, disco, drinks etc etc. Now don't blame me if the result surprises you.

Yes, we all follow the same cycle in our lifestyle. We stimulate ourselves with something. We remain high on that stimulation for some time. When the effect is over, we start feeling low. We crave for the next stimulation. When we get the next stimulation, we again get high and happy.

Just like dopers can't keep getting high on the same dope again and again, and that they have to move onto different things in due course of stimulation cycle, so do we. If shopping is our stimulant, it has to keep getting more and more expenseive. If tourism is our stimulant, it has to keep getting longer and grandeur.

So, how different are we from the dopers? The difference lies in detail alone. As such we are not doing anything fundamentally different.

>Like a surfer we are,  
Now we get high on a wave,  
Now a wave overcomes us and smashes us down,  
Stimulation to stimulation like an adept,  
Or dullness to dullness like a clumsy man,  
Or alternating between the two like a mediocore,  
We ride the waves of experiences,  
In the grand ocean of life.
