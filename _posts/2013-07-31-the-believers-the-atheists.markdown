There are two types of believers-in-God I've seen: a) those who never questioned the concept of God and just accepted what they heard from others, b) and those who questioned the concept of God & made investigations around it. And all the atheists that I've seen fit somewhere between these two believers; the ones who never questioned God & the ones who questioned and investigated. In other words, I've found atheists to be the people who questioned but didn't investigate enough.
