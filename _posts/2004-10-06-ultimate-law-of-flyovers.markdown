"Construction of flyovers keeps cumulative inconvenience to travellers constant"

Proof:

We have to first consider 2 basic laws:

1. Construction of flyover at one point shifts the bottleneck to another point. However, the next bottleneck may not be that severe when the flyover construction gets over.

2. Traffic increases with time. We can derive from law 1 that there would be some relief after the construction of flyover BUT NOT complete relief as there is another bottleneck next to the fly-over point.

We can derive from law 2 that the next bottleneck *will* become as severe as the previous one as traffic increases over a period of time.

Put law 1 & 2 together and you get: Any relief from fly-over is smalland short-lived. Offset it with the extra inconvenience that you went through during flyover construction.

And what you get is the ultimate law of flyovers: "Construction of flyovers keeps cumulative inconvenience to travellers constant".
