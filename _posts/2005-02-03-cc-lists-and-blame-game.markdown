How many people (on an average) do you keep on your Cc list for all your official mails?

This one was easy. So, let me ask a difficult one. Why? Why do you put so many people on your Cc list?

Is it only for keeping them in loop? That's what I also used to think. But sometimes I feel there is another purpose. By putting so many people on the Cc list, you avoid taking full ownership of what you are saying. The Cc list tends to signify a couple of things: 1. the people in Cc list agree with what is being said, 2. if there is anything wrong with what is being said, then the people on Cc list should intervene now (otherwise, the blame will be shared).

Hmmm. I guess I read something like [Politics oriented software development](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/1/28/32622/4244)
