<blockquote>Put forth your best and don’t think about the results too much, because come what may you cannot better your best.</blockquote>


My friend Hari Om has written a humorous and very insightful post on [pressure in corporate life](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090131054005/http://shariom.blogspot.com/2008/09/pressure-test-of-character-or-test-of.html).

An item on my must-read list. Some more stuff from there -


<blockquote>There is another kind of pressure. Sometime we stretch ourselves, and consciously or unconsciously set the benchmark for us. Since life always do not let us operate in perfect conditions, but in general the expectations do not take into account all these factors. Thus we continuously engage into stretching ourselves. Since stretching in one direction makes our life severely disbalanced, thus we feel the heat on the other fronts in life. Now, the natural reaction is not to eliminate the original stretching, but we start stretching ourselves more. Example we set a benchmark at work place. But consistently performing at your personal high level costs you your personal space happiness. Your family is at the stake. The first reaction is to somehow manage this all. Thus we get into the loop of managing things rather then living the life.</blockquote>
