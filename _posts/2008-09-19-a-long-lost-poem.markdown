Were you the first ray of sun  
That kissed me good morning?

Or you were the breeze  
That touched me deep inside?  
So deep, that I felt a sensation  
Even in my heart

Or you were the rain  
That tempted me to dance?  
Out in the open  
And left me all drenched?

So many times I met you  
Even before I saw you

Yes, you are my love.
