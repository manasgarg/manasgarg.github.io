Voices I heard  
One after another  
Voices that merged into each other  
Voices that overlapped each other

There was no one speaking  
Still voices I heard

There was no one around  
Still voices I heard

One after another,  
Yet another yet another  
Rising in my consciousness  
Familiar voices I heard

Stupefied I sat  
In awe and curiosity  
Seeking an explanation  
From the voices leading me

Who are you and what do you want?

Above the chattering rose a voice  
Clear, loud, confident and intimidating

We are your past  
Do you not recognize?  
You gave us birth  
Do you not cognize?

Born out of your past deeds  
We hold your future as seeds  
Your attention is what we seek
