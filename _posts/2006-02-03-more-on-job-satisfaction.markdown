So, [Sahu believes](http://structured-chaos.blogspot.com/2006/02/ramblings-continued.html) that "Job satisfaction has got nothing do with the job content."  

100% agreement.  

You can be doing anything and be satisfied/dis-satisfied.  

Satisfaction is a state of mind and is purely internal to our mind. Job is an external thing. We can't find what is internal in an external object.  

I remember one of Kabir's doha from my school days:  

"Kasturi Kundali base, mrug dhoondhe van mahi".  

Meaning: Kasturi resides in a deer's body. But the deer doesn't know and it keeps running around in whole jungle looking for Kasturi. [Note: Kasturi has a very sweet fragrance. A deer can sense the fragrance and wants to find out where it is coming from. It is unaware that it is _the_ source of that fragrance.]
