In this post, I am going to do a novel thing. I am going to repeat myself...   

I have cribbed once about the traffic in Bangalore. And I am going to crib again.  

Bangalore traffic has gone bad to worse and worse to even-worse. I think from even-worse, it can only go to worst.  

So, why am I cribbing? Because this tuesday, I spent three and a half hours in my car just to travel to office and back. Now, that's A LOT OF TIME.  

If you are planning to move to Bangalore, reconsider your decision. It's expensive, noisy, polluted and god-damned chaotic!!
