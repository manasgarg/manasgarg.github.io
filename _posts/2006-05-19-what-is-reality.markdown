Do you know what reality is?  

How is it defined?  

Is it something that exists outside us OR it is something that we agree upon?  

What is the difference between subjective reality and objective reality? Can multiple subjects arrive at objective reality?  

Out of all the things that we take for real (including material stuff like buildings, cars etc and mental stuff like theories, philosophy etc), what all is real and to what extent?  

Is a theory real?  

is philosophy real?  

Are truth and reality one and the same things?  

Can reality change?
