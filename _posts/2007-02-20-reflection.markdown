On the horizon I saw,  
A reflection curious enough  
I went and touched it,  
Only to see it getting dissolved

Who was it, what it sought  
Coming out of nowhere,  
And disappearing in thin air

Now it whispers, now it beckons,  
All my past deeds, now it reckons  
Ever persuasive and yet elusive  
Yes, on the horizon I saw it

Who are you, finally asked I  
I am thee, so was the reply
