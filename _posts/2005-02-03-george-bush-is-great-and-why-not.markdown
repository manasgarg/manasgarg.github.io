Don't you think George Bush is great? No?? Think again. Still no? Ok, let me ask you something else. Do you think Alexander was great? Yes. Then why not George Bush?

What made Alexander great? That he conquered many countries, killed a lot of people who had never bothered him in his life, looted the rich and poor alike, burnt down the cities, villages and fields, ruined monuments so on and so forth.

Alexander wasn't behind any development in art, culture or technology. His contribution to philosophy and spiritualism was exactly zero. He didn't create any benchmarks of administration. He had no notion of ethics, fairness, values and manners.

So, if he was great, so were Napolean, Hitler and even George Bush! And why not?
