Quoting some more stuff from 'Ayurveda: Life Health and Longevity' [I am sure Sahu will like this as it was one of his favourite college days gripe ;]  

<blockquote>  
Another of the reality-forming ideas that shape our world is the idea of progress. Linear progress, the belief that the old should be progressively replaced by the new, is a concept that has developed over only the last two hundred years or so.  

A progress that blindly assumes the inherent superiority of the new creates new and unforeseen problems.
