All that I have written so far pales in front the [this brilliance](http://shariom.blogspot.com/2008/09/pressure-test-of-character-or-test-of.html). Hats off!  
  
Some gems -  
  
_While preparing for a challenge, there is a parallel mental game which we subject ourselves to. While we are engaged in the preparation we start developing the fear of failure syndrome._  
  
_Sometime we stretch ourselves, and consciously or unconsciously set the benchmark for us. Since life always do not let us operate in perfect conditions, but in general the expectations do not take into account all these factors. Thus we continuously engage into stretching ourselves._  
  
_Thus the some characters in the hierarchy in group, who are supposed to take decisions, starts building the fear failure mania and starts feeding this back to the whole group._  
  
_Don't leave a path without concluding it, as situations created by the fickle minded jokers will ask to to dig hundred 10 inch holes to see if there water underground._  
  
_put forth your best and don't think about the results too much, because come what may you cannot better your best. Thus you have already contributed for the worst case scenario._
