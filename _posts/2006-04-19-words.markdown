A heated argument at the lunch table.  

Six people.  

Dissection and criticism of reservation policy, labour policy, democracy and what not.  

This should not be done. That should be done. Oh no, not _that_ but _**that**_.  

Charged up atmosphere.  

Passion in the eyes and fire in the belly. Arguments, counter arguments, friction and heat.  

Conclusions, predictions, allegations.  

Action Items: None.  

Empty words!  

Words, o words,  
How empty you are.  
You carry a thought,  
A spark of energy.  
Taking birth in one mind,  
Dying in several.  
Not transmuted into action,  
You carry no life and have no significance.  
Oh, empty words,  
I renounce thou!
