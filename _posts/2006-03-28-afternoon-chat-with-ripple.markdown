Had a pre-lunch chat with Ripple. Thought I'll share...  

me: Thought I'll checkout on the web what all digital cameras are available.  
There are hundreds of them there.  
I just got overwhelemed.  
Ripple: woh to hai..  
me: Reminded me of the age we live in.  
Now I know why people were happier and merrier in old times  
And why stress is problem #1 today.  
Ripple: haan.. ab to agar bread bhi khareedni ho to tension ho jaati hai..  
kaun sa lein..  
me: Earlier, if they wanted to buy a digital camera, they won't have to decide which one.  
Ripple: so I can justify my impulsive buying in some way :D  
me: This whole concept of 'Customer is the king' seems to be the moth eating away an entire generation.  
Ripple: haan.. par isi blind consumerism se hi .. economy badhegi ..  
aur hamein milega.. false sense of happiness and security  
:)  
isko rok nahi sakte..  
apne aap ko is-se alag karne ki thodi koshish kar sakte hain..  
me: We'll also get sense of sadness (uska camera mere camera se bada kaise?) and sense of insecurity (if I don't keep up with the pace, I'll not be able to maintain my lifestyle).  
Ripple: isiliye false sense ...  
jab tak maine uska camera nahi dekha..  
tab tak to bahut khushi hogi..  
:)  
aur sirf uska camera mere se achchha kaise nahi..  
"hain !! uske paas bhi yahi Camera ?!!"  
:)  
me: ;)  
Ripple: "sabke paas yahi camera, badalna padega!!"  
me: ha ha ha!!  
Interesting thing is that this behaviour is not new.  
In Vendantic philosophy, precisely this is what has been called Maya.  
What we have today is just a bigger form of the same thing.  
Ripple: haan..aaj camera aur gaadi hai..  
pehele tha.. "arey unke ghar mein roz parathe bante hai !!"  
"hamare ghar mein sirf roti"  
me: ya fir, unke ghar mein to doodh ki nadi bahti hai.  
aur roj roti per dher sara ghee laga ker khate hain.  
Ripple: heirarchy of needs  
ek poori kar .. doosri khadi ho jaati hai..  
me: I think it is more like a web than heirarchy  
Ripple: web kaise ? do u have choices when u satisfy one..  
it just goes up..  
me: If you look at it price-wise, it goes up.  
Because the price goes up.  
If you remove the price factor, it is just a web.  
If you have a digital camera, you need a computer.  
If you have a computer, you'll have mp3 which means you need to have broadbandn  
Ripple: not just price.. once I satisfy my physical needs.. I start looking at spiritual needs  
me: satisfy physical needs?  
Can you do that?  
Ripple: pet bhara ho.. neend poori hui ho.. a/c laga ho..  
to soch us plane mein chali jati hai..  
jaise abhi ..hamare saath ho raha hai..  
waise abhi bhookh lag rahi hai.  
:))  
me: Precisely.  
Ripple: chalna hai Anadhra meals khaane  
?  
me: Physical needs (or sense-pleasures as they are called), can be satisfied only for a moment.  
Ripple: physical comfort I should say then  
me: But comfort also doesn't have limit.  
You have a house, you want a bigger one.  
You have a car, you want one with power-steering and AC.  
If you have that too, you want the one with bigger seats.  
There is really no end.  
All satisfaction of senses is momentary.  
Ripple: yes we doo need that ...but there are times with most people when they say.. this is it for the time being..  
me: Yes. And it is only a matter of how long that 'time being' is.  
Ripple: yes..  
me: In my case, I have found that 'the time being' was always far shorter than I initially expected it to be.  
;)  
Ripple: chalna hai khaane .. Bharati ya Bhagini  
?  
me: Chalo. Chalte hain.  
Neeche milo.  
Ripple: okay....
