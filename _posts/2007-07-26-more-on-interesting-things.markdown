It's an extension to my last post about [Interesting things](http://manasgarg.livejournal.com/13790.html). I think the "thing" that is done and the "way that thing is done" are not two different things. They are two sides of the same coin. So, a thing cannot be interesting if done in a boring way. Similarly, a thing cannot be boring if done in an interesting way.

I read somewhere that Larry Wall was doing the seemingly boring job of creating some reports when he developed Perl. After this, who can say that creating reports is boring :)
