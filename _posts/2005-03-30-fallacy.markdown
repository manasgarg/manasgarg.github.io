Dr. Michael C. Labossiere has done a wonderful job of documenting [types of fallacies](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/). I want to learn each one of them by heart so that I can use them in arguments against the person resorting to any of these fallacies.  

Myself: A site like [AbsoluteHousing](http://www.absolutehousing.com) must provide RSS feed of locations that become available for rent.  
Other Person: Of course, you would say that because you are blogger.  
Myself: Your statement can be categorized as [Ad Hominem fallacy](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem.html).
