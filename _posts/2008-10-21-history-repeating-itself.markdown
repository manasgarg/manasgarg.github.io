During my school history lessons, I learnt that India was divided in small parts whose kings used to keep fighting with each other for more territory. That made the country so weak that invaders from outside could conquer the country.

I used to always think how stupid of those kings who were so busy fighting with each other and couldn't see a big picture. Why didn't people of that age resist this kind of foolishness?

And well, after all the stuff about Alexandar, Mahmood Gazhanavi, Moguls, Britishers and other European colonizers has happened, we still have small kings ruling small estates and fighting with each other to increase their territory.

And what are we people doing? Nothing.
