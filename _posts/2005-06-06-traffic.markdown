So, after a very long time, I was out on the road at 9:00 AM. Of course, as usual, heading to office. I used to travel a bit late but today I had to drop Vaishali so I left early.  

And well, I decided to never repeat the mistake. Today, it took me 1 hour 15 minutes to get to office. Why? Traffic, traffic, traffic.  

It is at times like this, you ask yourself very fundamental questions. Is this what I was born to do? I'll never ask my kid what she wants to do when she grows up. I know she won't be right. She'll never say , "Papa, when I grow up, I want to drive through sick and frustrating traffic for several hours a day". But that's what she would do anyway.  

What a sheer waste of human capital!!  

Well, by the way, the answer I gave myself for *the* fundamental question was "NO". I was not born to do this and I won't do this for my life. There are always choices one can make.  

By the way, I was [ not the only one](http://sthalluri.blogspot.com/2005/06/monday-morning.html) to go through frustration.
