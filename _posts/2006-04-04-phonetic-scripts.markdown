Ripple and myself were trying to see what all languages in the world have phonetic script. To at least my surprize, we couldn't recall a language outside India that has a phonetic script. Whereas, the scripts of each and every language of India are phonetic ones.  

Is anyone aware of a language outside India that has phonetic script?
