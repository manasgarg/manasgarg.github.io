It's amusing to see that how our mind can play a child (do something "obviously" wrong), play a father (scolding oneself for that "obviously" wrong act) and play the mother (reconciling the matters).

It becomes the desire to indulge and the refrain from that indulgence and the guilt arising out of that desire. All fighting with each other.

And in a flash, all three would be gone.
