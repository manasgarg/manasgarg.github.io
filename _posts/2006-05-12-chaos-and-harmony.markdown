>Q: I do see and admit that the outer chaos is merely a reflection of my own inner disharmony. But what is the remedy?  
M: Don't seek remedies.  

   -- Nisargdatt Maharaj, I am That  

I vividly remember one of my experience in Bombay. I would travel 22 kms to my office everyday on my bike. On some days, the bike would be difficult to maneuver, the road would be full of potholes, the traffic would be aggressive and chaotic, the sun would be too harsh. And on another days, bike would be pleasant, road just fine, traffic smoothly flowing, and sun not all that harsh.  

When I looked back and analyzed, I found that the only difference was whether I had breakfast before leaving for office or not.
