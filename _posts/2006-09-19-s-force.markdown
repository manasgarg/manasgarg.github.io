Enter a shopping mall.

Every sellable object in the mall is arranged such that it looks at you and screams, "don't you want to take me?"

Even if you are just accompanying your friend, you would either end up buying something for yourself too OR at least you'll have to put up a great amount of resistance to not buy anything.

If you have to put in some force (on your mind) to not buy something, there is bound to be another force (of roughly equal measure) that is prompting you to buy something.

What is that force? I don't know how to define that force but I have felt it everytime I visit a mall. I even have a name for it, S-Force (S stands for Shopping). Some malls have it stronger than others.

Have you gone to a mall to buy nothing but ended up buying a jeans/shirt?
