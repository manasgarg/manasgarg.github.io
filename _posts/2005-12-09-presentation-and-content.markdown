Sahu [raised a question](http://structured-chaos.blogspot.com/2005/12/presentation-versus-content.html) whether presentation is superior or content.  

I think it is difficult to separate the two. Presentation and content are the integral part of anything.  

Look at music. If you define the content, there are just seven notes. All the symphonies are created by presenting those seven notes in different way.  

I believe, presentation is not superior to content. It is the content.
