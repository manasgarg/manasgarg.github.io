Can you hear the silence?  
Can you speak the silence?  
Can you touch the silence?  
Can you smell the silence?  
Can you see the silence?  

Silence is a word but is it a thought? No, it is absence of thought.  
Is it a feeling then? No, it is absence of feeling.  
Is it knowledge then? No, it is absence of knowledge.  
Is it an expression then? No, it is absence of expression.  

Saying anything about silence means disturbing the silence.  

Silence just is.  
After the mind has left one thought and before it moves to next thought, silence is.  

You and me know that silence is. But do we know what silence is?
